The Drawbridge~
       An enormous wooden drawbridge is all that stands between you and the
chilly water below.  To the north of you, you can see the great portcullis
that guards the entrance to the fabled city of Camelot.  To the south, you
can still see the lands of Xania through the hazy fog, but to the east an
impenetrable wall of fog blots out the view.  You can hear water lapping
on a shore somewhere, possibly below you...

The Southern Courtyard.~
        The hustle and bustle of every day life in a large city is epitomised
here in Camelot.  People mill around you, all going about their business in
their own little worlds - almost like a hive.  That's where the similarity
with a hive ends - the courtyard is bedecked in linens and beautiful flowers,
such as you have never seen.  The people, though poor, all seem quite content.
The great Castle of Camelot looms above you to the north.

wants everyone to believe in the legendary wealth of Camelot.  The walls
are hung with gilt edged battle flags, many of them depicting the great
attles that King Arthur and his men have won.  The floor is carpeted in
thick fresh hay, giving of a very sweet aroma, the occasional heavy footmarks
hardly leave a mark on it.

the battles faught and won by King Arthur and his brave knights.  From the
decor of the room, it is easy to surmise that this used to be the war room
of the king, but since he brought peace to his lands it has been no longer

criss cross the corridor to create the impression that the walls of Camelot
have veins like aliving animal.  The secret door to the west is obviously

Taking a closer look at the paintings, you discover that they are of Arthur's
fore-fathers.  Uther Pendragon stares down at you relentlessly and you begin
to get uncomfortable under his unwaverring gaze.

people posing for the artists.  They all seem to be staring straight through

At the Corner of the East Wing.~
        The bare walls seem to be closing in on you.  A wave of nausea hits
you and you can't help feeling claustrophobic in this environment.  A glint
of light can be seen through a small aperture cut into the wall in the angle
of the corner.  To the west, the North Wing extends into the distance and to
the south, the East Wing disappears out of view.

Opposite some Large Iron Doors.~
        Some huge iron doors stand to the south blocking your view of what
lies within.  You can hear the sounds of male laughter and the occasional
clank of armour.  From the sounds of it, there is a body of fighting men
inside...

Inside the War Room.~
        This enormous room houses the legendary Round Table.  The most
renowned of Arthur's knights are invited to become Knight's of the Round
Table, an elite fighting force.  These men are highly trained and dedicated
killers, but fiercely loyal to their king.  The room is decorated in the
colours of each knight, depicting his family heritage, and battles he has
fought and won.  The bright colours of the knights dazzle you, and the sea
of faces becomes a blur.

Inside a small chapel.~
        This elegant chapel is small to the standards of Xania, where there
are numerous Gods to worship.  The people who frequent this chapel dedicate
their lives to the "One" God.  The altar is a structure made almost totally
of gold, with an enormous wooden crucifix adorning the front.  There are
rows of benches either side of a main, silk carpeted walkway leading
directly to the altar.  A picture of their "Christ" hangs above the altar,
staring down at you from the heavens.  There is a small door in the south
wall.

same fashion as the chapel.  There is a small altar with a large golden
crucifix fixed to the top, in front of which is a small kneeling cushion.
The King spends a lot of his time here, contemplating his life, loves and
victories.  Your intrusion has broken his concentration!

with a similarly green covered felt.  There is a clothes chest at the foot
of the bed, and a large crucifix stands atop it.
