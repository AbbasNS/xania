Xania infrastructure
--------------------

This directory contains files and configuration pertaining to the live and test
Xania instances. It's not part of the general Xania source code: if you just
want to run the MUD locally, you need not worry about these contents. If you'd
like to host your own MUD on AWS, then this directory might be useful or
inspirational to you. As it is, it's pretty specific to the setup we use.
