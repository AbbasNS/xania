Xania is a land brimming with potent horrors and inspiring innovations.
You will find, amongst other things:
<p>
<ul>
<li>a rigorously tested race/class system including the likes of 
barbarians, knights, fearsome dragons, half-elves and hobbits
<li>a broad selection of original and classical areas, <b>all</b> of which
have been converted to the Xania format
<li>non-player characters that communicate with players and remember
their opponents
<li>an organised clan system where members have their own secure 
homelands and communication channels
<li>a great selection of skills and spells, including mounted combat and 
wild magicks
<li>player duelling, in a combat arena over which other players can 
spectate (and gamble!)
<li>an advanced newsgroups system in addition to the traditional 'notes'
system
<li>object interaction more advanced than that seen in original ROM code,
for example, the inability of certain races to use objects of a certain
material type, and unique objects which can be worn in weird locations
<li>a pleasant user interface which is intuitive, friendly and features
a really nifty colour system (which isn't horribly garish like some MUDs!)
and lots of online help
<li>loads more, which only <b>you</b> can discover!
</ul>
