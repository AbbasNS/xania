<h2>
The real life version
</h2>
<p>


Xania was created by five bold implementors, The Moog, Death, Faramir, Rohan
and Wandera. They're all Brits and this is certainly evident from
      the rather Brit-oriented features of the game!
They were joined by two others, LuxoR and Forrey, who have both
contributed to Xania's unique character. 
<p>
Of course, the thing which REALLY makes the MUD so good are the
      players. Yeah, it sounds cheesey, but YOU the player are the most
      important aspect of the game and without you, Xania would just be
      a database and a whole stack of source code.

<h2>
The brief history of Xania's ancient peoples
</h2>
by <a href="http://www.xania.org/">Faramir</a>
<p>
Xania is  a land  which was once  populated by  the ancient Iscarians.
Legend has it that this race of people  held a culture of great beauty
and wisdom. It was their early efforts at  creating a peaceful, lawful
society which resulted in cities such as Midgaard being founded in the
otherwise barbarous Xanian  lands. Their original temple still  stands
today in Midgaard   and it is  there  where  you can see  some  of the
examples of the Iscarian livelihood.
<p>
Many an  age has passed since the  construction of the city and during
that time, evil  infiltrated the works of  the Iscarians. It came from
the  wild outlands, manifested  in the form of blood-crazed barbarians
who brought unparalleled terror to the innocent and death to those who
did not submit.
<p>
Nobody really knows the source of this  potent malice, but Midgaardian
scholars who have studied the stars have come to  a concensus that the
Iscarians were a   race doomed to  destruction ever   since their very
creation. For it  is believed that the source   of their demise  was a
fundamental flaw  in  the design  of the  cosmos itself; something so
powerful that even the mighty  Isca-sorceri, the Iscarians learned  in
the ways of magic, were unable to thwart its progress.
<p>
Apart from the Temple  of Isca and a  few  of the tomes  detailing the
Lore of Xania, there is very little left of the Iscarians today. A few
scattered   peoples roam  the  land   claiming  that  they are  direct
descendants   of Isca but few   acknowledge  this, and  some, such  as
disciples of   the Great Wyrm,   hold a  completely different  view of
Xanian history and hold the Iscarians in contempt.
