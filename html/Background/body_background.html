They're all Brits and this is certainly evident from the rather Brit-oriented features of the game! They were joined by two others, LuxoR and Forrey, who have both contributed to Xania's unique character. </P>
<P>Of course, the thing which REALLY makes the MUD so good are the players. Yeah, it sounds cheesey, but YOU the player are the most important aspect of the game and without you, Xania would just be a database and a whole stack of source code. </P>

<P>Xania is a land which was once populated by the ancient Iscarians. Legend has it that this race of people held a culture of great beauty and wisdom. It was their early efforts at creating a peaceful, lawful society which resulted in cities such as Midgaard being founded in the otherwise barbarous Xanian lands. Their original temple still stands today in Midgaard and it is there where you can see some of the examples of the Iscarian livelihood. </P>
<P>Many an age has passed since the construction of the city and during that time, evil infiltrated the works of the Iscarians. It came from the wild outlands, manifested in the form of blood-crazed barbarians who brought unparalleled terror to the innocent and death to those who did not submit. </P>
<P>Nobody really knows the source of this potent malice, but Midgaardian scholars who have studied the stars have come to a concensus that the Iscarians were a race doomed to destruction ever since their very creation. For it is believed that the source of their demise was a fundamental flaw in the design of the cosmos itself; something so powerful that even the mighty Isca-sorceri, the Iscarians learned in the ways of magic, were unable to thwart its progress. </P>
<P>Apart from the Temple of Isca and a few of the tomes detailing the Lore of Xania, there is very little left of the Iscarians today. A few scattered peoples roam the land claiming that they are direct descendants of Isca but few acknowledge this, and some, such as disciples of the Great Wyrm, hold a completely different view of Xanian history and hold the Iscarians in contempt. </P>
