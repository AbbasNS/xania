<P></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT"></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">If you have never come across a MUD before then you have missed out on a feature of the Internet which carries greater depth and richness than you might hope to imagine. In brief, a MUD is a game, a fantasy realm which you can be a part of. Each MUD is unique, some are quite radically different whilst you will find that others possess close similarities. </P>
<P>You, as a &quot;mudder&quot;, partake in the fantasy experience by creating your own &quot;character&quot; before entering the world beyond. There you will join in the game with all the other players who are present. The world is described textually. Some places feature very graphic, detailed descriptions whilst others are more concise, allowing your own imagination to fill in the gaps. The players you'll find will be varied in age and experience and a MUD can be an easy way to make new (but distant!) friends. </P>
<P>Many MUDs allow you to determine the qualities of your new character, such as race, skills, strengths and weaknesses. If you are a fantasy reader, you may have a passion for becoming a wizard or barbarian - some MUDs will allow you to explore your fantasies. Some MUDs don't allow you to &quot;build&quot; a character straight away, whilst on others you only learn of your character's powers once you have &quot;come of age&quot;. </P>
<P>Most of the time, the only software required to play a MUD is a terminal emulator, although specialised &quot;MUD clients&quot; also exist which are programmable and have many useful features. You control your character by issuing simple commands. You should be able to get a good list of commands by typing &quot;help&quot;, whichever MUD you are on - and there are thousands out there! </P>
<P>The other critical requirement is imagination. You only get out of a MUD what you put in, so it usually makes sense to roleplay your character. It is a player's imagination which brings dynamism to a MUD's otherwise narrow electronic existence. Some people prefer to skip imagination and play for other reasons, for example many MUDs are very competitive and offer rewards for completing difficult quests. </P>
<P>Precisely how a MUD works depends heavily on the way the Gods and Implementors of the fantasy realm have decided to form it. Some worlds are strictly controlled by their rulers with tight guidelines and behavioural protocols. Other realms are much more lax where just about anything goes. It this latter type of MUD you will tend to find the greatest imaginative works and you may also have the greatest difficulty surviving! </P>
<P>Bear in mind that like most games, a MUD will have rules. Usually you can read these by typing &quot;rules&quot; or &quot;help rules&quot;. You will find that it may take you a little while to discover how things work but many MUDs are very friendly, full of other characters willing to assist. Some even have artificially intelligent beings who can help you out. </P>
<P>One essential distinction to be drawn is whether or not a MUD allows the killing of players. This is called PKILL and MUDs which allow this tend to be more hostile and indeed, more realistic than others. If you are a newcomer to the world of MUDs you may find that a non-PKILL MUD is best for you. Some players get hooked on exercising their aggression on other player characters. PKILL MUDs have pros and cons - they can give rise to all kinds of interesting scenarios which you would not get on a non-PKILL MUD. However, they can also become domains for the power-hungry. </P>
<P>By playing the game, your character will become stronger and more skilled. On some MUDs, you can then take an even deeper role, for example you might start a clan with a historical background. You might also become a God, but on popular and well organised MUDs this usually requires a lot of dedication. There lies the danger of MUDs - they can be very addictive and may consume large quantities of your time. </P>
