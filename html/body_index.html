<P></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT"></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">The rusty iron gates have once again been opened, the swords unsheathed, the ancient scrolls of lore, unfurled. Cities of merchants, craftsmen, mercenaries and wizards are teaming with activity and adventurers step out into the wilderness to try their hand at achieving the fame and fortune which is only bestowed upon those who are highly skilled, enduring and perhaps, fortunate. </P>
<P></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Xania, a world once famed for its enticing riches and bravehearted warriors, has fallen upon arduous times as the clutches of chaos and evil have swept across its vast wastelands and into the lives of its civilised denizens. Many bold individuals have been tempted to step into the line of conflict, willing to chance their luck in a world of misfortune where the rewards can be extravagant for those who succeed. <BR>Will you be one of the
fortunate few? </P>
<P>Xania is a multi-user dungeon originally based upon ROM2.3. Within the boundaries of this fantasy realm there is much to be discovered, for both new and experienced MUD adventurers alike.
