<P></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT"></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">First there was nothing, and there came a time when the Gods saw fit to create a good and peaceful land. When their creation was finally completed and named Xania, it was a time of much rejoicing. This great land was ruled by the wise dragons who were bestowed with all the knowledge of this world. This knowledge was called the lore, and the dragons were entrusted with it's safe keeping. For many centuries the dragons ruled and Xania's inhabitants lived in peace and harmony. They felt secure that the wise dragons and their knowledge of the LORE could aid them in times of trouble and confusion. </P>
<P>But then came bad times, several of the dragons saw the potential for abuse that the power of the LORE gave them. They twisted its power to serve their own purposes, and used this knowledge to wreak havoc on the lands of Xania. These greedy, power hungry dragons plundered and pillaged the lands, snatching its treasures for themselves. It was a time of darkness for all the inhabitants of Xania. </P>
<P>The few good dragons left waged war on the evil ones. And the battles where fierce. Whole cities were destroyed and burnt to the ground, many brave citizens who banded together against the evil ones were slaughtered. It is said that in places the blood flowed like a river, and the screams of dead and maimed echoed through the valleys. </P>
<P>Horrified by what was occuring in their own lands, the Gods decided to intervene. They used their awesome power to destroy the evil ones, the few survivors were cast from the lands. Those good dragons who still lived were put into slumber and ordered to awaken if the evil ones ever returned. Sadly, amongst all the fighting and destruction much of the LORE was gone. The people of Xania returned to their burnt out towns and villages to rebuild much that they had lost. The brave dead were buried and their heroism is still echoed today in many of the ballads of the bards. </P>
<P>The people of Xania prayed that one day a hero may take them back to the happy times that they had lost, and that one day the LORE may be restored. One day that hero came from the mists of the battle-fields of Xania. He was an elf and his name was Tanis. Tanis saw that the LORE had to be restored for peace to return to Xania and he swore that he would do everything in his power to return it. He explored much of these lands recording what he found and learnt from his experiences. On his travels he met two other great heroes. Ragnar, the mighty barbarian minotaur whose strength and cunning was legendary throughout the lands. Firestorm, the powerful hobbit mage whose magical powers and knowledge were second to none. He asked them to join him in his quest and between them they pledged to restore the lost LORE. Tanis and his allies built the Library of Enlightenment to store that that they had found and recruited followers from far and wide to record the rediscovered knowledge of Xania. Now the Library is the finest in all Xania, its four walls are the boundaries to boundless knowledge. The triad of allies still continue their quest and there is still much to be done. </P>
