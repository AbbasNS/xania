<h2>
The Disciples of the Wyrm
</h2>
<p>
Of  all  the races  that  of dragon  is the most  ancient on Xania.
Before the  creation of Xania, before  the universe was forged, before
the  immortals  were born,  even before  the   beginning of time there
existed the Great Wyrm.
<p>   
Before  the dawn of time  the Great Wyrm  was  all that existed. He
lingered  in  an  eternal  slumber  and  experienced   a  multitude of
dreams. These  dreams became more and  more vivid  and real until they
began to take on physical forms. Thus in the silence and darkness, the
immortals were born.  The Great Wyrm watched the immortals antics with
amusement.....until they created Xania.
<p>      
Soon after their world   took shape, the immortals discovered  that
their bounty was tainted with evil. This worried the great dragon, for
he found that  his  dreams were  disturbed by  horrifying  images.  He
could  feel another consciousness slowly  forming, which could perhaps
gain power to rival his own.  After great deliberation, the Great Wyrm
decided that  he must  make others in  his own  form, who would embody
virtue  and power.  He would create  beings who  would carry forth the
rites of the Wyrm. So the dragons of Xania were born.
<p>
The most ancient of all the dragons was Samael,  and the Great Wyrm
appeared to  his disciple and taught him  of the virtues  that he must 
uphold.  The  first   was  that  he must    crush all  evil   that  he
encountered.  Secondly,  he was to  help all those of good intentions,
in order to ward against the encroachment of evil and chaos.  Thirdly,
he was instructed to protect the weak  from injustice. Finally, he was
to  spread the word of  the Wyrm to others  and gather about him those
who embody the spirit of the dragon, whether  they possess the body of
a dragon or not.
<p>   
And so the Disciples of the Wyrm  were founded, a great temple hewn
from ancient rock and  the timeless task of   upholding the wishes  of
Great Wyrm begun.

<h2>
The Keepers of the Lore
</h2>

First there was nothing,  and there came a  time when the Gods saw fit
to create a  good and peaceful  land. When their  creation was finally
completed and named Xania, it was a time of much rejoicing. This great
land was  ruled by the  wise dragons  who  were bestowed with  all the
knowledge of this  world. This knowledge was  called the lore, and the
dragons were entrusted with it's safe keeping.  For many centuries the
dragons ruled and Xania's inhabitants lived in peace and harmony. They
felt  secure that the   wise dragons and   their knowledge of the LORE
could aid them in times of trouble and confusion.
<p>
But then came bad times, several of the  dragons saw the potential for
abuse that the power of the LORE gave  them. They twisted its power to
serve  their own purposes,  and used this  knowledge to wreak havoc on
the lands of  Xania. These greedy, power  hungry dragons plundered and
pillaged  the lands, snatching its  treasures for themselves. It was a
time of darkness for all the inhabitants of Xania.
<p>
The few good dragons left waged war on  the evil ones. And the battles
where  fierce. Whole  cities were destroyed   and burnt to the ground,
many brave  citizens who banded  together  against the  evil ones were
slaughtered. It is said that in places the blood  flowed like a river,
and the screams of dead and maimed echoed through the valleys.
<p>
Horrified by what was occuring in their own lands, the Gods decided to
intervene. They used their awesome power to destroy the evil ones, the
few survivors  were cast from the  lands. Those good dragons who still
lived were  put into slumber  and ordered to awaken   if the evil ones
ever returned. Sadly, amongst all the fighting and destruction much of
the  LORE was gone.  The people of Xania  returned  to their burnt out
towns and villages to rebuild much that they had  lost. The brave dead
were buried and  their heroism is  still echoed today  in many  of the
ballads of the bards.
<p>
The people of Xania prayed that  one day a hero may  take them back to
the happy times that they had  lost, and that  one day the LORE may be
restored. One day  that hero came  from the mists of the battle-fields
of Xania. He was  an elf and his  name  was Tanis. Tanis saw  that the
LORE had to be restored for peace to return to Xania and he swore that
he would do everything in his power to return it.  He explored much of
these  lands   recording   what  he   found   and  learnt   from   his
experiences. On his travels he met two other great heroes. Ragnar, the
mighty barbarian minotaur  whose strength  and cunning was   legendary
throughout the lands.  Firestorm,   the  powerful hobbit  mage   whose
magical powers and knowledge  were second to   none. He asked them  to
join him  in his quest and between  them  they pledged to  restore the
lost LORE. Tanis and his allies built the  Library of Enlightenment to
store that that  they had found and recruited  followers from  far and
wide to record the rediscovered knowledge of Xania. Now the Library is
the  finest in  all Xania,   its  four  walls  are the  boundaries  to
boundless knowledge.  The triad of  allies still  continue their quest
and there is still much to be done.

<h2>
The Shadow Council of Mephistopheles
<p>
</h2>
Long  ago, in the land  of Xania, there  lived a human mercenary named
Klaus.  Klaus wandered the  areas surrounding Midgaard and New Thalos,
using his strength,   and  skill  with   a sword  to  earn   gold  for
himself. On one such day, he was asked by an old  man to help him do a
job. When Klaus  agreed, and had completed  the chore, the man refused
to to give him the  gold he had  promised.  Klaus, his temper flaring,
drew his blade and viciously murdered the man.
<p>
Little did he know, however, that  far away, the Shadow Daemon
Mephistopheles    had  witnessed    this  grisly  event   unfold  with
interest. Seeing  great  potential in Klaus, he   summoned  him to his
chamber, and and made him an offer. He  promised Klaus great power and
a high position  in his kingdom, as long  as he would  lead the Shadow
Council.  Klaus readily agreed, and  was given what was promised. With
this power,  as it turned out, Klaus  was transformed into a Werewolf,
with strength, speed, and toughness  far beyond that  of a human. With
his  newfound powers, he  was placed as leader  of the Shadow Council,
and instructed by Mephistopheles to  make the Council strong, and keep
Evil in Xania forever.
