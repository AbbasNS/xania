<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>
<b>
Knights
</b>
<p>
<ul>
Knights are a noble fighting class. They make extensive use of traditional
duelling techniques to defeat their foes and are skilled in most weapons.
Knights know less of the world than clerics or mages, but their direct
combatative approach has a great tendency to work all of the time! Most
knights
would sneer at a passing mage, unable to believe that their fuzzy arcane
methods would get them anywhere. However, knights do appreciate the
protective value of magic and most learn spells of this nature fairly early
on in life. Best of all, knights simply LOVE marching round in expensive
shiny armour, so they tend to spend most of their time searching the
world for the best kit!
<p>
</ul>
<b>
Barbarians
</b>
<p>
<ul>
Barbarians are hardened cut-throat warriors who use hand to hand combat
techniques in order to survive. Barbarians have the natural ability to
beat their opponents into a pulp before recovering very quickly. They
have a strong belief that knights in shining armour are just a bunch of
wimps with too much money. In addition, they don't like magic very much
as they find it unrealiable compared to their trusty combat skills.
Barbarians make great (but often stupid) leaders and are renowned for
their unparalleled charisma.
<p>
</ul>
<b>
Mages
</b>
<p>
<ul>
Mages specialise in the casting of spells, offensive ones in particular.
Mages have the highest-powered magic of any class, and are the only classes
able to use the draconian and enchanting spell groups (although at higher
levels, these skills are available to other classes too). They are also very
skilled at the use of magical items, though their combat skills are the
weakest of any class.
<p>
</ul>
<b>
Clerics
</b>
<p>
<ul>
Clerics are strong-willed individuals who hold great faith in a particular
religious sect. They combine great magical abilities with healing powers
and combat prowess, making clerics an excellent all-round class. Clerics
are widely known for being good at everything but are rarely as sorcerous
as their mage counterparts, or as strong as their knight and barbarian
comrades. 
<p>
</ul>

<p>
<h2>
Races
</h2>
<p>
<b>
Humans
</b>
<p>
<ul>
Humans are the most common race in the world, and make up the majority of
adventurers. Although they have no special talents like the other races,
they are more versitile, being skilled in all four classes.
<p>
It has to be said that for a variety of reasons, the humans of the world
of Xania are known to be weaker than their human brethren in other
worlds. If you are used to being a human on another MUD then beware,
because humans are more of a challenge here!
<p>
</ul>
<b>
Dwarves
</b>
<p>
<ul>
Dwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul temper and great
stamina.  Dwarves have high strength and constitution, but poor dexterity.
They are not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to their long
lifespans.  Dwarves make excellent fighters and priests, but are very poor
mages.Dwarves are resistant to magic, poison and disease, but cannot swim, and
so are very vulnerable to drowning. They can see in the dark with infravision.
<p>
</ul>
<b>
Elves
</b>
<p>
<ul>
Elves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build.  They
lack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are for more agile,
both in body and mind.  Elves are pretty good at being mages, but have at
best fair talent as knights or priests. An elf barbarian would have a hard
time. Elves resist charm spells most effectively, due to their magical nature.
However, they are burned by the touch of iron, and so are barred from the
use of iron or steel in their adventuring careers.  Elves are notoriously
hard to spot, and this is reflected by the fact that they recieve the sneak
and hiding skills automatically. They may see in the dark with infravision.
<p>
</ul>
<b>
Half-elves
</b>
<p>
<ul>
Half elves are an unusual combination of humans and elves, featuring the
finest aspects of both. They are a little stronger than elves but are not
quite as wise. Half-elves have the benefit of being able to see in the
dark and sadly, are vulnerable to iron.

Their attractive, light build means that they are naturally quite nimble
and are renowned in combat for not being in the same place as their
opponent's sword, no matter how hard the opponent tries!
<p>
</ul>
<b>
Eagles
</b>
<p>
<ul>
Eagles are a remarkable race - they are very wise being well known for
their knowledge of the world and tremendous mobility. Eagles are good
all round, in combat and when using magic. They have the unique ability
of being able to fly all the time.
<p>
</ul>
<b>
Dragons
</b>
<p>
<ul>
Dragons are huge, old and wisened monsters, known for incredible strength,
intelligence and wisdom. They can't move around very quickly, but they know
a lot of magic, and have a lot of physical power. It is easy to kill things,
but you only gain experience for killing things that you can't just walk over.
It takes you a lot of time to gain experience. They know many skills
instinctively from birth: draconian breath spells, and transportation.
<p>
</ul>
<b>
Orcs
</b>
<p>
<ul>
Orcs are an ancient, humanoid race whose outstanding feature is their
swarthy, green, leathery skin. Their deep-set reddish eyes and highly
defined faces givem them fearsome characteristics, and Orcs are infamous
for being devlish and evil.
<p>
Whilst not being the brightest of individuals, Orcs are pretty tough. They
don't get on too well with humans and experience animosity towards dwarves
and elves. Magical Orcs are quite rare but greatly feared, nonetheless,
as they are noted for having superior combat prowess in comparison to their
elven, perhaps even human, counterparts.
<p>
</ul>
<b>
Hobbits
</b>
<p>
<ul>
Hobbits are small humanoid beings, with a friendly face and perculiar furry
feet. They are very quick and nimble, as well as being rather clever. However
they are far from being physically resilient or strong. Hobbits are renowned
for being excellent mages, even though they are generally far too shy and
modest to admit this to be the case. Most hobbits have very specialised skills
which enable them to undertake their devious deeds.....
<p>
</ul>
<b>
Minotaur
</b>
<p>
<ul>
These huge beasts have muscular humanoid bodies, topped by large, very ugly
bull heads with flaming red eyes. Basically, they're not the kind of creature
you want to meet in a dark alley. Minotaurs are notoriously strong and
damn tough but their mental capabilities are sometimes lacking. The
specialities of a minotaur include crude fighting skills which somehow, give
the minotaur the uncanny knack of _never_ losing a fight.
<p>
</ul>
<b>
Wolves
</b>
<p>
<ul>
Wolves are fascinating creatures - quite tough, very swift and strong and
reasonably wise too. They make great fighters and usually have other
abilities like being able to see in the dark. Xanian wolves find silver
disagreeable but this does not detract from their unmatched nobility.
