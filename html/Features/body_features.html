<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Xania is a land brimming with potent horrors and inspiring innovations. You will find, amongst other things: 
<UL TYPE="DISC">
<LI>a rigorously tested race/class system including the likes of barbarians, knights, fearsome dragons, half-elves and hobbits </LI>
<LI>a broad selection of original and classical areas, all of which have been converted to the Xania format </LI>
<LI>non-player characters that communicate with players and remember their opponents </LI>
<LI>an organised clan system where members have their own secure homelands and communication channels </LI>
<LI>a great selection of skills and spells, including mounted combat and wild magicks </LI>
<LI>player duelling, in a combat arena over which other players can spectate (and gamble!) </LI>
<LI>an advanced newsgroups system in addition to the traditional 'notes' system </LI>
<LI>object interaction more advanced than that seen in other MUDs of this type for example, the inability of certain races to use objects of a certain material type, and unique objects which can be worn in weird locations </LI>
<LI>a pleasant user interface which is intuitive, friendly and features a really nifty colour system (which isn't horribly garish like some MUDs!) and lots of online help </LI>
</UL>
<P>LOADS more, which only you can discover! </P>
