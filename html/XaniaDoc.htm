<hr><a name="Intro"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>

This document is designed as a cross between a reference and a tutorial on creating your own areas for the Multi-User Dungeon, 
<a href="http://www.xania.org/~xania">Xania</a>.  Xania was created in the mid-nineties, and was originally based on a ROM2.3 code base.
Most MUDs are not written from scratch, but take a previous MUD's code and build upon it; Xania took Russ Taylor's ROM2.3 code and built
upon that.  Since Xania was created, ROM2.4 has been created, and Xania has put some of the more important features from ROM2.4
into its repertoire, as well as some features unique to Xania.
<p>This document is aimed at those who already have a working knowledge of Xania from a player's point of view.  If you haven't
already acquired some player knowledge, then you're way out of your depth trying to write areas, so go play 
some <a href="telnet://xania.org:9000">Xania</a>!

<!-- Basics section -->
<hr><a name="Basics"><h2>Building basics</h2></a>

If you are a higher-level player on Xania you will already be aware of the vast array of data Xania holds on each object,
mobile and room.  As an area builder it is your responsibility to ensure each object and mobile has stats commensurate with
its level - so no putting in level 10 wands of level 50 acid blast!  This is probably one of the hardest parts of area building
- striking the balance between making mobiles too easy to kill or objects too powerful, and making the area so difficult that
no-one will visit it.  We'll try to give you some hints as how to make this the case.

<p>Before you start your area, we'd recommend sketching out a rough plan of your area on paper, along with where you want
your mobiles to be, and which equipment they'll carry.  Also what objects you'll have in your area, either lying on the
ground or being carried by mobiles or locked in chests or hidden away in rooms.  It's much easier to write the area file if
you have a reasonably good idea how the whole thing is going to fit together.

<p>A quick word on VNUMs before we go any further.  They'll crop up everywhere, so I thought it best to mention them now rather
than in each section.  A VNUM is a 'virtual number' - a piece of terminology that makes little or no sense, but nevertheless
it's important you understand what they are.  A VNUM is a 'reference number' that uniquely references an object, room or mobile.
Imagine that every object, room or mobile is created from a template on a filing card - you know, those cards that dentists and
doctors used to keep your details on before computers cropped up everywhere.  The filing card has all the details needed to create
a new mobile, object or room - a name, description, statistics and so on and so forth.  However, as many objects, rooms and
mobiles refer to each other in some way (for example mobile X wears object Y on its arms) the referencing is done by VNUM.
So in an area file, you'll be creating things like 'a blue monster', and giving it a VNUM, say 1000.  When you want to place
two of that kind of monster in a room, you'll load 'monster 1000' twice in the #RESETS (more of that later).  Similarly, when
you're describing the exits from one room to another, you'll use the VNUM of the rooms to do so; room 1010 is north of room 1009,
for example.  It's worth mentioning that monster 1000 is different to room 1000 is different to object 1000, so you can re-use
the vnums across different types of 'thing'.  VNUMs mustn't clash across different areas though - your VNUMs must be different
to everyone else's - so speak to an Immortal before you start your area for a good set of VNUMs to use.
Hopefully all that will be a lot clearer when we get into the area file proper.

<p>Another note on strings.  No, not pieces of twine, but the text of descriptions, names and suchlike.  In the Xanian (and ROM)
file format, strings end with a tilde character (~).  This lurks above the hash character on UK keyboards, but on US keyboards
may be up on the top left somewhere - I'm sure you'll find it.  Let me give you an example, which is an object from the Flying
Citadel area:

<p><pre>
#13028
sleeves chain mail chain-mail~
a pair of chain-mail sleeves~
Some chain-mail sleeves have been left on the ground.~
iron~
armor 0 AI
11 12 9 1 0
34 6 20 G
E
sleeves chain mail chain-mail~
A pair of dented and buckled chain-mail sleeves. Not very comfortable, but
usable enough.
~
</pre>
The number after the hash character at the top is the VNUM we mentioned earlier.  The next line is the keywords for the object;
these are the words the player can use to refer to the object.  Notice how this line ends in a tilde?  The next line is the
short name, used when you pick up the object.  The next line is the long description - how the object appears when left on the
ground.  Ignore the rest until the 'E' on its own (we'll go over this fully in the #OBJECTS section later).  The 'E' section is
the 'extra' section which allows us to put more descriptions of the object in when the player 'looks' at it.  In this case we're 
totally replacing the long description with a longer, more verbose description.  Notice how the tilde is on a line by itself, after
the description, and notice how the description is split to fit onto two lines?  This is for a reason:  all of the text mustn't scroll
past 80 characters of screen, so we've word-wrapped 'usable enough' onto a new line.  The tilde is on its own for an important reason:
it means that the following text will be forced onto the next line.  Without the tilde on its own line, any text following it will
continue on the same line - looking very messy.

<p>Right, now take a deep breath and relax.  Sitting comfortably?  Got a nice cool glass of water nearby?  Put the dog/children/spouse
somewhere they're not going to disturb you?  Phone on answermachine?  Good - you're ready to start!  Load up your favourite
text editor - be it Notepad for windows, EMACS under Linux/BSD, UltraEdit, MSDev or whatever, as long as it saves files as 'text
files' that's fine.  This means MS Word is <b>not</b> suitable, in case you were wondering - unless you want to get really
handy with cut and paste, I'd forget it - Notepad is fine.  The first thing we'd suggest you do now is save the empty file somewhere
with an appropriate name before you forget!  The area file <b>must</b> have the extension <i>.are</i> for example <i>flying.are</i>.

<p>The area file is split up into chunks of information - each chunk starts with a hash character and a name.  The order isn't
important, except for the <b>#AREA</b> section, which must go first, and so we deal with that next.

<h6><a href="#top">Back to the top</a></h6>




<!-- Area block -->
<hr><a name="AREA"><h2>The <b>#AREA</b> block</h2></a>

The <b>#AREA</b> block is the simplest and shortest block of data - it describes some basic information about your area
which is used in Xania when you enter the 'areas' command.  Here is the Flying Citadel's <b>#AREA</b> block:

<p><pre>
#AREA   
flying.are~
The Flying Citadel~
{20 50} TheMoog The Flying Citadel~
13000 13050
</pre>

The first line tells Xania that this is an area block.  The next line is a string which is the filename of the area file - this may
be used in later version of Xania for on-line creation - just ensure its the same name that you saved your area earlier.
The next string is the area name - at the moment only used internally.  The next string is the line shown in the 'areas'
command in Xania - the lower lever and higher level in curly brackets, followed by the author's name, followed by the area name.
The last line in this section is the low and high VNUM limits - the lowest VNUM you used and the highest VNUM you used in that
order.  As VNUMs mustn't clash across areas (VNUMs in your area mustn't be the same as anyone else's) this helps the Immortals
ensure there are no problems of this sort.

<p>That's it!  That's your first step to creating your own area!  After this block, the order isn't too important; but we'd suggest
you go onto the rooms next, as this is the basic skeleton that all areas need.

<h6><a href="#top">Back to the top</a></h6>




<!-- Rooms block -->
<hr><a name="ROOMS"><h2>The <b>#ROOMS</b> block</h2></a>

This is one of the more complicated blocks, so we'll take it slowly and explain some of the attributes a room has, then we'll
examine a room from the Flying Citadel and explain what everything means.

<p>Rooms are slightly different to mobiles and objects, because there is only one room per VNUM, whereas there can be many
copies of a mobile or object.  In practise this doesn't make much difference, but its worth mentioning to help your understanding
of resets, towards the end of this document.  A room has a VNUM, a short and long description, a sector type and some room options.
For reasons lost in the obscurity of programming, these options are bundled together and called 'flags' - and 'cos we're programmer
types, we'll be calling them flags too.

<p>As well as these pieces of information a room usually has one or more exits.  These exits have a direction, a short description,
a keyword or name, a type and key VNUM and some more flags, and perhaps most importantly, the VNUM of the room they lead to.
Usually when you design the rooms you link rooms back to eachother; that is, going east from room A to room B is the same as
going west from room B to room A - but this isn't done automatically, you have to put an easterly exit in room A <em>and</em> a
westerly exit in room B back to room A.  Of course, you can build some evil mazes where going back west from room B takes you
to another place to confuse the player, but make sure you don't abuse this power too much or your player will get upset very quickly!

<p>The last pieces of information a room can have are 'extras' - little areas of interest that the player can 'look' at to get
more information about the area they are in.  The example below should help show you how this works:

<p><pre>
#13004
Citadel North-East~
You feel the wind ruffling your hair - the source of the rushing air a huge
hole in the north wall.  Pointing out of the window is a huge rusted metal
siege cannon.  Standing on tip-toes you can just about peer through the huge
hole - and you can see the mountainous terrain.  A ladder leads up to a trap-
door in the ceiling.
~
13 D 1
D4
The ladder leads upwards to a trap-door in the ceiling.
~
trap-door trap door~
1 -1 13017
D3
You see an open space to the east.
~
~
0 -1 13005
D2
You can see a corridor to the south.
~
~
0 -1 13003
E
seige cannon rusted metal~
This device has obviously not been built by the draconians, rather stolen from
some castle or other - still, it is a powerful machine.  You can smell burnt
gunpowder, and you see wisps of blueish smoke trail out of the barrel of the
cannon.
~

</pre>

The first few lines should be fairly self-explanatory: they are the VNUM, the short name and the long description.  The short
name is shown if the player has brief descriptions on, if not, both the short and long name are shown.  As an aside, put any warnings about 
high-level areas in the short name so that players with brief mode on can see them!  Notice that the tilde in the long description
lives on its own line, to give a nice space after the text.

<p>After that comes a line of numbers and letters, separated by spaces.  The first is the area number; it is actually no longer used
in Xania, you can place 'XX' or the first two numbers of your VNUM block here.  In Flying Citadel, we put '13' as the VNUMs range from
13000 to 13050 are used.  The next letter is the room flags - those options we mentioned earlier.  Flags are usually a set of letters
where each letter is an option that is to be turned on.  In this case, the only room option is 'D' which is the indoor flag.  A room
which only two people can occupy, that is dark, and that you can't recall from would have 'AJN' in this part of the file.  Don't
worry too much about which flag means what, the <a href="#Reference">reference section</a> has a list of all the possible flags for all
parts.  The last part of this line is the sector type; the type of terrain this room is comprised of.  In this case sector type 1
is 'city'.  The sector type is used by Xania in calculating how much movement (mv) it takes to cross the room.  Again, you'll find all
the sector type in the <a href="#Reference">reference section</a>.
