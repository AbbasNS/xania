		<TD WIDTH=568>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Knights are a noble fighting class. They make extensive use of traditional duelling techniques to defeat their foes and are skilled in most weapons. Knights know less of the world than clerics or mages, but their direct combatative approach has a great tendency to work all of the time! Most knights would sneer at a passing mage, unable to believe that their fuzzy arcane methods would get them anywhere. However, knights do appreciate the protective value of magic and most learn spells of this nature fairly early on in life. Best of all, knights simply LOVE marching round in expensive shiny armour, so they tend to spend most of their time searching the world for the best kit! </FONT></TD>

		<TD WIDTH=568>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Barbarians are hardened cut-throat warriors who use hand to hand combat techniques in order to survive. Barbarians have the natural ability to beat their opponents into a pulp before recovering very quickly. They have a strong belief that knights in shining armour are just a bunch of wimps with too much money. In addition, they don't like magic very much as they find it unrealiable compared to their trusty combat skills. Barbarians make great (but often stupid) leaders and are renowned for their unparalleled charisma.</FONT></TD>

		<TD WIDTH=568>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Mages specialise in the casting of spells, offensive ones in particular. Mages have the highest-powered magic of any class, and are the only classes able to use the draconian and enchanting spell groups (although at higher levels, these skills are available to other classes too). They are also very skilled at the use of magical items, though their combat skills are the weakest of any class.</FONT></TD>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Cleric</FONT></B></TD>
		<TD WIDTH=568>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Clerics are strong-willed individuals who hold great faith in a particular religious sect. They combine great magical abilities with healing powers and combat prowess, making clerics an excellent all-round class. Clerics are widely known for being good at everything but are rarely as sorcerous as their mage counterparts, or as strong as their knight and barbarian comrades.</FONT></TD>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Human</FONT></B></TD>
		<TD WIDTH=582>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Humans are the most common race in the world, and make up the majority of adventurers. Although they have no special talents like the other races, they are more versitile, being skilled in all four classes. </P>
<P>It has to be said that for a variety of reasons, the humans of the world of Xania are known to be weaker than their human brethren in other worlds. If you are used to being a human on another MUD then beware, because humans are more of a challenge here!</FONT></TD>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Dwarf</FONT></B></TD>
		<TD WIDTH=582>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Dwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul temper and great stamina. Dwarves have high strength and constitution, but poor dexterity. They are not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to their long lifespans. Dwarves make excellent fighters and priests, but are very poor mages.Dwarves are resistant to magic, poison and disease, but cannot swim, and so are very vulnerable to drowning. They can see in the dark with infravision.</FONT></TD>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Elf</FONT></B></TD>
		<TD WIDTH=582>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Elves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build. They lack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are for more agile, both in body and mind. Elves are pretty good at being mages, but have at best fair talent as knights or priests. An elf barbarian would have a hard time. Elves resist charm spells most effectively, due to their magical nature. However, they are burned by the touch of iron, and so are barred from the use of iron or steel in their adventuring careers. Elves are notoriously hard to spot, and this is reflected by the fact that they recieve the sneak and hiding skills automatically. They may see in the dark with infravision.</FONT></TD>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Half-elf</FONT></B></TD>
		<TD WIDTH=582>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Half elves are an unusual combination of humans and elves, featuring the finest aspects of both. They are a little stronger than elves but are not quite as wise. Half-elves have the benefit of being able to see in the dark and sadly, are vulnerable to iron. Their attractive, light build means that they are naturally quite nimble and are renowned in combat for not being in the same place as their opponent's sword, no matter how hard the opponent tries!</FONT></TD>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Eagle</FONT></B></TD>
		<TD WIDTH=582>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Eagles are a remarkable race - they are very wise being well known for their knowledge of the world and tremendous mobility. Eagles are good all round, in combat and when using magic. They have the unique ability of being able to fly all the time. </FONT></TD>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Dragon</FONT></B></TD>
		<TD WIDTH=582>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Dragons are huge, old and wisened monsters, known for incredible strength, intelligence and wisdom. They can't move around very quickly, but they know a lot of magic, and have a lot of physical power. It is easy to kill things, but you only gain experience for killing things that you can't just walk over. It takes you a lot of time to gain experience. They know many skills instinctively from birth: draconian breath spells, and transportation. </FONT></TD>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Orc</FONT></B></TD>
		<TD WIDTH=582>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Orcs are an ancient, humanoid race whose outstanding feature is their swarthy, green, leathery skin. Their deep-set reddish eyes and highly defined faces givem them fearsome characteristics, and Orcs are infamous for being devlish and evil. </P>
<P>Whilst not being the brightest of individuals, Orcs are pretty tough. They don't get on too well with humans and experience animosity towards dwarves and elves. Magical Orcs are quite rare but greatly feared, nonetheless, as they are noted for having superior combat prowess in comparison to their elven, perhaps even human, counterparts.</FONT></TD>

		<TD WIDTH=96>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Hobbit</FONT></B></TD>
		<TD WIDTH=582>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Hobbits are small humanoid beings, with a friendly face and perculiar furry feet. They are very quick and nimble, as well as being rather clever. However they are far from being physically resilient or strong. Hobbits are renowned for being excellent mages, even though they are generally far too shy and modest to admit this to be the case. Most hobbits have very specialised skills which enable them to undertake their devious deeds..... </FONT></TD>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Minotaur</FONT></B></TD>
		<TD WIDTH=582>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">These huge beasts have muscular humanoid bodies, topped by large, very ugly bull heads with flaming red eyes. Basically, they're not the kind of creature you want to meet in a dark alley. Minotaurs are notoriously strong and damn tough but their mental capabilities are sometimes lacking. The specialities of a minotaur include crude fighting skills which somehow, give the minotaur the uncanny knack of <B>never</B> losing a fight.</FONT></TD>

		<TD WIDTH=96>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Wolf</FONT></B></TD>
		<TD WIDTH=582>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Wolves are fascinating creatures - quite tough, very swift and strong and reasonably wise too. They make great fighters and usually have other abilities like being able to see in the dark. Xanian wolves find silver disagreeable but this does not detract from their unmatched nobility. </FONT></TD>
